# Digital-Data-For-Development

The datasets presented here are ones that underlie the visuals at linkedindata.worldbank.org. The datasets cover four categories of metrics: 1) Industry Employment Shifts, 2) Talent Migration, 3) Industry Skills Needs, and 4) Skill Penetration. LinkedIn and the World Bank Group plan to refresh the data annually at a minimum. The datasets are annual time series and go back to 2015.

Each category of the metrics is provided in a separate file with a cover sheet listing the variables names, definitions, and caveats. Country coverage varies slightly between metrics because of different data extraction and quality control rules. Countries with at least 100,000 LinkedIn members are included in the datasets. If more countries cross this threshold in the future, new countries can be added during the annual refresh.
