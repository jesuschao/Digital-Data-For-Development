### PURPOSE

The aim of this project is to offer an idea through some visualizations about how digital transformation has shaped our work environment. We can see in these graphics the evolution between 2015 and 2019 of growth employment, changes in industry and most demanded skills. Some questions that could be arised would be;

How is the talent distribuited geographically?, which are the target countries for specific industries or skills? or just what the evolution through these last years is like for some specific skills?

This work intends to answer these questions. 

Datasets taken from Kaggle has been evaluated and cleaned using Python and all graphics/visualization has been prepared using Power BI.
